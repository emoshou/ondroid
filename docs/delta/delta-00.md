![Delta](/delta/delta00render1.PNG)

Inspired by a tweet by [Kenneth Cassel](https://x.com/KennethCassel/status/1811797731351974067), the ondroid Delta is three axis robot powered by three stepper motors.

At $2,100 USD, the robot is [affordable relative to the current market,](https://www.igus.com/product/20437?artNr=DLE-DR-0050) but has room to improve.
