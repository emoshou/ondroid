## Can I use another software package?
Yes - as long as it is licensed for **unrestricted** commercial use. 

Example; Fusion360 is not allowed (unless you pay for it). The free version does not allow for **unrestricted** commercial use.

### This Sounds Silly - why can't I use Free Software?
ondroid is Open Source under an Open Source license, but our license allows for unrestricted commercial use. By using free offerings of commercial CAD software without unrestricted commercial licensing, you jeopardize your work being removed from the project or worse, opening the project up to legal issues.

### List of Unapproved CAD Packages
- Shapr3D Free Version
- Fusion 360 Free Version (Autodesk Fusion for personal use)
- Solidworks Maker
    - This is not an unlimited commercial license, as it has a cap of $2k/year revenue attached to the license. This makes it __a commercial__, but not an __unrestricted__ commercial license
- Siemens NX Student
