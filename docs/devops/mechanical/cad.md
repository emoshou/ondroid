## Official Project CAD Package
The official CAD software of ondroid is [Ondsel](https://www.ondsel.com) (a FreeCAD derivative). Ondsel files are backwards compatible with FreeCAD, so in the case you'd prefer using FreeCAD, you're able to open files with it but without the assembly functionality.

## Assemblies
Assembly owners are responsible for managing part PRs and placement recommended by the engineers designing parts.

## Can I use another software package?
Yes - as long as it is licensed for unrestricted commercial use. 

Example; Fusion360 is not allowed (unless you pay for it). The free version does not allow for unrestricted commercial use.

### This Sounds Silly - why can't I use Free Software?
ondroid is Open Source under an Open Source license, but the license allows for unrestricted commercial use. By using free CAD software, you jeopardize your work being removed from the project or worse, opening the project up to legal issues.

### List of Unapproved CAD Packages
- Fusion 360 Free Version (Autodesk Fusion for personal use)
- Solidworks Maker
    - This is not an unlimited commercial license, as it has a cap of $2k/year revenue attached to the license
- Siemens NX Student
    
### List of Approved CAD Packages
This is not a definitive list but only provided to offer guidance:
- Solidworks
- Fusion 360 (Commercial License)
- FreeCAD
- Plasticity

## Part Placement
Parts can be drawn in any orientation. Their position is controlled at the assembly they reside in.
