# CAD
## Official Project CAD Package
The official CAD software of ondroid is [Ondsel](https://www.ondsel.com) (a FreeCAD derivative). Ondsel files are backwards compatible with FreeCAD, so in the case you'd prefer using FreeCAD, you're able to open files with it but without the assembly functionality.

## Assemblies
Assembly owners are responsible for managing part PRs and placement recommended by the engineers designing parts.

## Part Placement
Parts can be drawn in any orientation. Their position is controlled at the assembly they reside in.
