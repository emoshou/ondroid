# CAD
## Official Project CAD Package
The official CAD software of ondroid is FreeCAD. The plan is to move to Ondsel once they implement the TNP solve and assemblies are in a reliable place.

## Can I use another software package?
Yes - as long as it is licensed for commerical use. For example, you may use Fusion 360, as long as it is the paid version. The free version is not valid as it does not allow for commerical use.
