# Software DevOps

## Language
Python is the preferred language of the project.

## Data Storage and Exposure TLDR
Extra work is created in storing engineering data in YAML format, but it is necessary for the following reasons:

### Interoperability
Plain text formats are easily readable by various software tools, including spreadsheets and scientific computing environments like MATLAB. This allows for seamless data exchange between different systems and programs.

### Human Readability
Unlike binary formats, plain text is directly readable and editable by humans. This makes it easier to review, modify, or debug data without specialized tools.

### Version Control
Text-based formats work well with version control systems like Git, making it easier to track changes over time.
Accessibility: Plain text files can be opened and edited with simple text editors, reducing dependency on specific software.

### Data Integration
It's straightforward to import plain text data into databases or other data processing systems.

By using this method, you ensure that your Pint values are not only preserved with their units but also remain accessible and editable across a wide range of software and platforms.
