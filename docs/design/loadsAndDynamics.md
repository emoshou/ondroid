# Loads and Dynamics
Loads and structural dynamics is a specialized field in humanoid robotics we're developing that focuses on understanding how a robotic structure responds to dynamic (time-varying) forces within its operational environment.

 In humanoid robotics, these dynamic loads include forces such as those generated by walking, running, jumping, and manipulating objects, as well as external forces like impacts or environmental interactions. Dynamic analysis in this context involves determining the vibration frequencies and mode shapes of the robot, as well as time histories or frequency response spectra of displacement, velocity, acceleration, internal force, or stress. Such analyses ensure the robot can perform its tasks reliably without structural failure.
