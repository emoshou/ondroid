# Design Constraints
## Materials
Aluminum and stainless preferred.

Plastics (except for bearings or cowlings) are disqualified until the project can source anisotropic materials analysts (go to [Contribute](../gettingStarted/index.md) if that describes you!)

## General Engineering 
- Design for sheet metal manufacturing (CNC Laser, Waterjet, press braking, etc.). Machined parts that require CNC are likely to be rejected in PRs (exceptions made for actuator components)
### Welding
Welding is not permitted for Aluminum as it more than halves the allowable yield stress of the material.

Welding Steel is permitted, provided it takes place at manufacture and not assembly (in situ).
