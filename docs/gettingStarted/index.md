# Mechanical Engineering
We need to engineer the robot. If you don't know where to start, join the Discord and introduce yourself. We can find something for you to do.

# Lawyer
There is a ton to do - from incorporating non-profits, to, well, everything. This is undiscovered field that needs your help.

# Machinist
Help us program CAM, offer DFM and help design things for cost effectiveness generally speaking.

# Software Engineering
A lot needs to be done. Generalists who want to learn about Computational Geometry, Robotics or ML should join the Discord and pick up tasks (or generate their own).

# DevOps Engineer
Mechanical Engineering is an incredibly under-represented section of the engineering disciplines with pretty bad software. We need you to help us glue [FreeCAD/Ondsel](https://ondsel.com) to various CAD packages, simulation software, and more.

We also need to figure out better ways to manage CAD files from deployment and diffing to product life cycle management.

# Industrial Designer
Help us make the robot friendly. CAD modelers who don't have an ID background but know how to use surfacing techniques shouldn't be afraid to hop in and assist.

# Frontend Engineer
We barely glued together this MkDocs running on GitHub pages. We need people to help build out a more comprehensive website. We also plan on running the front end through a web interface.

# Roboticist
Join the discord, post papers, and help the Software Engineers understand IK.

# Electrical Engineer
There's a lot to do in the controls department, but even more with motor drivers.

# Generalist
Join the discord, chat, read papers, and ask how you can help.
