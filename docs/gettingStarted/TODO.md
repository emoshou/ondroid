# Mechanical Engineering
- Mechanical Concept Design
    - Open up the TLA, pick a sub-assembly, and start designing.
        - Join the Discord to work with the other engineers to understand key interfaces and design constraints.
- Actuator Concept Design
    - Perform engineering analyses to weigh the pros and cons of the following options:
        - Winch Actuation
        - Hydraulic Actuation
        - DD Actuation
    - Actuator Placement
- Materials Database
    - Material Comparison
        - Change current analysis to measure specific strength against cost per pound, not just yield strength

# Software Engineering

- Part Number Generator
    - A front end developer is needed to code the front and back end logic to create a [Component Number](../design/componentNaming.md) assignment tool 

# Software DevOps
- Write Python script to automatically import and place STP files at part load
    - Should search the local directory for part numbers based on a BOM
